1
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:12,031
Taking that internship 
in a remote mountain lab

2
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:14,539
might not have been the best idea.

3
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,291
Pulling that lever wth the skull symbol
just to see what it did

4
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,743
probably wasn't so smart, either,

5
00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:23,278
but now is not the time for regrets

6
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,223
because you need to get away
from these mutant zombies fast.

7
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:32,236
With you are the janitor, 
the lab assistant, and the old professor.

8
00:00:32,236 --> 00:00:36,255
You've gotten a headstart,
but there's only one way to safety:

9
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:40,684
across an old rope bridge
spanning a massive gorge.

10
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:42,805
You can dash across in a minute,

11
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:46,265
while the lab assistant takes two minutes.

12
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:49,452
The janitor is a bit slower
and needs five minutes,

13
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:52,725
and the professor takes
a whole ten minutes,

14
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:56,031
holding onto the ropes 
every step of the way.

15
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:58,677
By the professor's calculations,

16
00:00:58,677 --> 00:01:02,611
the zombies will catch up to you
in just over 17 minutes,

17
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:08,778
so you only have that much time
to get everyone across and cut the ropes.

18
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:13,305
Unfortunately, the bridge can only hold
two people at a time.

19
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:14,729
To make matters worse,

20
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,972
it's so dark out that you can barely see,

21
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:21,698
and the old lantern you grabbed on
your way only illuminates a tiny area.

22
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:26,994
Can you figure out a way
to have everyone escape in time?

23
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:30,883
Remember: no more than two people
can cross the bridge together,

24
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:35,247
anyone crossing must either
hold the lantern or stay right next to it,

25
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:40,321
and any of you can safely wait in the dark
on either side of the gorge.

26
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:45,603
Most importantly, everyone must be
safely across before the zombies arrive.

27
00:01:45,603 --> 00:01:50,573
Otherwise, the first zombie could step on
the bridge while people are still on it.

28
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:53,007
Finally, there are no tricks to use here.

29
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:54,645
You can't swing across,

30
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:56,388
use the bridge as a raft,

31
00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:58,760
or befriend the zombies.

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,735


33
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:03,023


34
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,379


35
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:05,632


36
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:08,163
At first it might seem 
like no matter what you do,

37
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:12,691
you're just a minute or two short of time,
but there is a way.

38
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:16,997
The key is to minimize the time wasted
by the two slowest people

39
00:02:16,997 --> 00:02:19,088
by having them cross together.

40
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:22,621
And because you'll need to make
a couple of return trips with the lantern,

41
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:26,639
you'll want to have the fastest people
available to do so.

42
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,461
So, you and the lab assistant quickly
run across with the lantern,

43
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:34,646
though you have to slow down 
a bit to match her pace.

44
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:37,559
After two minutes, both of you are across,

45
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:41,287
and you, as the quickest, 
run back with the lantern.

46
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,213
Only three minutes have passed.

47
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:44,788
So far, so good.

48
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:46,614
Now comes the hard part.

49
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:50,320
The professor and the janitor take
the lantern and cross together.

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,949
This takes them ten minutes

51
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:55,460
since the janitor has to slow down 
for the old professor

52
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,460
who keeps muttering

53
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,501
that he probably shouldn't 
have given the zombies night vision.

54
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:03,248
By the time they're across,
there are only four minutes left,

55
00:03:03,248 --> 00:03:05,925
and you're still stuck
on the wrong side of the bridge.

56
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:10,965
But remember, the lab assistant
has been waiting on the other side,

57
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:13,790
and she's the second fastest of the group.

58
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,111
So she grabs the lantern 
from the professor

59
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:18,804
and runs back across to you.

60
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:23,010
Now with only two minutes left,
the two of you make the final crossing.

61
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,122
As you step on the far side of the gorge,

62
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,823
you cut the ropes 
and collapse the bridge behind you,

63
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:30,589
just in the nick of time.

64
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:33,415
Maybe next summer, 
you'll just stick to the library.
